# Hand-Written-Digit-Recognition
In this project using the TensorFlow framework and the Keras API, the Convolutional Neural Network is able to recognize and predict the hand written digits from the MNIST dataset.
First Load the MNIST dataset from the Keras API
Then we are using a simple Matplotlib code to visualise our data
Then we are reshaping our training and testing data and converting the input to greyscale
After that we are normalizing the parameters so that the values are between 0 and 1
Then we are Building a Sequential model and training it and also evaluating the model
Finally we are testing the model and hence making predictions using it.
